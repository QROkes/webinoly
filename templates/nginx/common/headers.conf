# CORS and Cache for static files
##################################

# CORS only needed for:
# - Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch APIs. (preflight mode may be needed, not included here)
# - Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS), so that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be loaded cross-origin and used by web sites that are permitted to do so.
# - WebGL textures.
# - Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage().
# - CSS Shapes from images.
# Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

# That means that most of the times is only used by fonts. (Simple request mode with wildcard is enough)

# NOTE: We have this location here (not in locations.conf) to add the HSTS header when needed in static files.
# Add the Strict-Transport-Security header to all HTTPS responses. https://hstspreload.org/#deployment-recommendations

# NOTE: The XML extension is not included in the static file list because it breaks the dynamically generated sitemaps (WordPress, for instance).
# NOTE: You can/remove extensions in the Webinoly Configuration file.
